# IV Curve Class

The SIS structure leads to a typical direct current (DC) voltage (IV) response. Experimentally, this response is obtained by sweeping the voltage up and down to conserve hysteresis behaviour. The voltage sweeping limits, the number of data points and a few other parameters depending on the experimental setup are controlled with a Labview readout programm. The program stores the data in `.csv` files with the following format, where the program has no header.

| Timestamp | Voltage [mV] | Current[$\mu$A]  |
|------------------------------|---------------|---------------|
| 17/10/2019  10:39:32\.934568 | 2\.411436E\+0 | 3\.538724E\-2 |

The developed `IV_Reponse()` class is designed to read IV curve tables and to compute the IV curves characteristics. The format of the input file can be defined through keyword arguments `**kwargs`, specifically
- `headerLines`' defines how many lines from the top of the raw data file are skipted.
- `footerLines` defines how many lines at the bottom of the raw data file are skipted. It is necessary to be defined if the file contains empty lines at its end.
- `columnOffset` defines how many columns need to be skipped to get to the voltage column.

In consequence, the `IV_Reponse()` class is not unconfined to the format as long as there is a voltage data column left next to a current data column. 

The presented testing uses data from QMix examples, which are in the format 
| DC Bias Voltage \(mV\) | DC Tunneling Current \(mA\) |
|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| 0\.016102              | 0\.007249                   |

| 0\.021257              | 0\.007378                   |
where the file also contains the header line. 

The data set contains a sweep up and down in voltage which is stored as argument `rawIVData`.
![Raw data by time.](IV_Class_Unit_Test/2020_01_02/Raw_Data_by_Time.svg)
The raw data is used to determine the offset. At the 0 V bias voltage and 0 A current, the slope in the subgap region shows a maximum. This can be seen from a plot of the `rawIVData`. 

![Raw IV Data](IV_Class_Unit_Test/2020_01_02/Raw_Data_at_Origin.svg)

The slope `unsortedSlope` of the `rawIVData` shows two peaks, one for the sweep with poitive voltage gradient and one for the negative voltage gradient. The slope is normalised for the voltage difference to account for uneven voltage spacing between `rawIVData` data points. 

![](IV_Class_Unit_Test/2020_01_02/Sorted_vs_Unsorted_Slope.svg)

The two largest values in `unsortedSlope` within an absolute voltage range `offsetThreshold` (usually 0.5 mV) are averaged to define the voltage offset `voltageOffset`. The current at the closest voltage in `rawIVData` is then used as current offset `currentOffset`. 

During the initialisation of the `IV_Reponse()` object, the `rawIVData` is sorted after increasing voltage in the argument `sortedIVData`. Both, `rawIVData` and `sortedIVData` are corrected for the `offset` to obtain `offsetCorrectedRawIVData` and `offsetCorrectedSortedIVData` respectively. The `offsetCorrectedSortedIVData` is then smoothened with a Savitzky-Golay filter to obtain a `savgolIV` dataset and the corresponding slope `savgolSlope`. The filter parameters are accessible via the `**kwargs` `savgolWindow` and `savgolOrder`.

![](IV_Class_Unit_Test/2020_01_02/Sorted_vs_Unsorted_vs_Filtered_Raw_Data.svg)

The `savgolIV` dataset is then further smoothened into equispaced voltage bins to obtain the `binedIVData`. The bins are defined by the `numberOfBins` which are equispaced between `vmin` and `vmax`. The equispaced voltage axis of the `binedIVData` has advantages in further processing as by computing the Kramers Kronig transformation. The slope of the `binedIVData` is computed as `binSlope`.

## IV Curve Characteristics
The IV curve characteristic values include the normal resistance, the subgap resistance, the gap voltage and the critical current.

The normal and subgap resistance is obtained from linear regressions through the `offsetCorrectedSortedIVData`. The voltage range for the linear regression is defined by `rNThresholds` and `rSGThresholds`, respectively. There are separate regressions through negative and positive bias voltages which are averaged to obtain the normal resistance `rN` and subgap resistance `rSG`.

![](IV_Class_Unit_Test/2020_01_02/Normal_Resistance_Fit.svg)
![](IV_Class_Unit_Test/2020_01_02/Subgap_Resistance_Fit.svg)

From the `binSlope` dataset, the maxima at the transission of the positive and negative bias voltage determine the gap voltage `gapVoltage` as average of the maxima. The maxima are searched in a voltage range defined by the key word argument `vGapSearchRange`.

There are two ways of determining the critical current. The first method defines the critical current as

$$I_\text{C} = \frac{V_\text{gap}}{R_\text{N}}$$

which is used for further calculations a `criticalCurrent_from_gapVoltage_rN` and `criticalCurrent`. The second method defines the critical current from the `binSlope` similar to the `gapVoltage` definition. The method uses the first negative slope after the gap voltage to define the `criticalCurrent_from_max_slope`. In general, this method results in a lower critical current and the method is more prone to false detection from noise.

The initialisation of the `IV_Reponse()` object computes the RRR value as the normal resistance at 300 K `normalResistance300K` is known. Futhermore, the junction seize can be defined as `junctionArea` to calculate area normalised values. However, area normalised characteristics are not included in the `IV_Reponse()` class at the moment.

## Simulated Data

A simulated IV curve can be fitted on the measured IV curve to work with more datapoints. There are several methods of simulating an IV curve implemented. 

The fitting routine described by Rashid et al. (2016) is implemented as `chalmers_Fit_calc()`. The simulated curve is described as 

$$TODO$$

where TODO.

![](IV_Class_Unit_Test/2020_01_02/Simulation_Chalmers_Transission.svg)

The remaining implemented methods base on a curve of step functions convolved with a gaussian. The easiest implementation `convolution_perfect_IV_curve_Fit_calc` assumes a 0 A subgap current, a step function at the transission and a normal resistance above the gap.

![](IV_Class_Unit_Test/2020_01_02/Simulation_Perfect_Subgap.svg)
![](IV_Class_Unit_Test/2020_01_02/Simulation_Perfect_Transission.svg)


The `convolution_without_excessCurrent_Fit_Calc` function include a nonzero subgap current, which has a step at 0 V from the negative subgap current to the positive subgap current. 

![](IV_Class_Unit_Test/2020_01_02/Simulation_Without_Excesscurrent_Subgap.svg)
![](IV_Class_Unit_Test/2020_01_02/Simulation_Without_Excesscurrent_Transission.svg)

A further extension of this method includes an excess current at the gap voltage. This should introduce a bump below and above the gap. The three methods doing this are 

- `convolution_most_parameters_Fit_Calc`

    All parameters are fitted during a single minimisation. 

![](IV_Class_Unit_Test/2020_01_02/Simulation_Brute_Fit_Subgap.svg)
![](IV_Class_Unit_Test/2020_01_02/Simulation_Brute_Fit_Transission.svg)


- `convolution_most_parameters_Fit_fixed_Vgap_Calc`

    The gap voltage is fixed during the minimisation.
![](IV_Class_Unit_Test/2020_01_02/Simulation_Fixed_Vgap_Subgap.svg)
![](IV_Class_Unit_Test/2020_01_02/Simulation_Fixed_Vgap_Transission.svg)

- `convolution_most_parameters_stepwise_Fit_Calc`

    The normal resistance region, the subgap region and the transission are fitted in three consecutive minimisation processes. This leads to the best result.

![](IV_Class_Unit_Test/2020_01_02/Simulation_Stepwise_Subgap.svg)
![](IV_Class_Unit_Test/2020_01_02/Simulation_Stepwise_Transission.svg)


The simulated IV curve `simulatedIV` which is used for further calculations is set using the method `set_simulatedIV`.

The keyword arguments for simulating the IV curve are 
`simulationVoltageSteps` defining difference between the voltage data points evaluated, `simulationVmin` and `simulationVmax` define the voltage range evaluated. 
`simulation_Sigma_Gaussian_Convolution_Guess` is the guess value for the width of the gaussian used in the convolution.

## Further Methods
The `Mixer` class introduced in the subsequent section requires some methods from the `IV_Response` class. The `gaussianBinSlopeFit_calc` method fits a gaussian on the slope of the transission. This is used to determine a width of the transission.

![](IV_Class_Unit_Test/2020_01_02/Gaussian_Fit_on_Positive_Slope.svg)


Furthermore, the `IV_Reponse` class contains the method `iKK_Calc` to compute the Kramers Kronig transformation. 

The `Mixer` class also needs also data from larger voltages than measured. This data is computed from a linear regression of the normal resistance in the `binedDataExpansion` method. Likewise there is an expansion method `iKKExpansion` for the Kramers Kronig transformation.

# Mixer Class

The `Mixer` class can take up to four IV curves, namely an unpumped IV curve `Unpumped`, a pumped IV curve `Pumped`, an IF response with a hot load `IFHot` and an IF reponse with a cold load `IFCold`. All of the four IV curves can be `IV_Response` objects or `IV_Response` object are initialised from a string input.

## IF Characteristics

IF characteristics are computed within the `IF_calculations` method,if  `IFHot` and `IFCold` are defined.
The IF characteristics computed are the y factor `y_Factor` and the noise temperature `noise_Temperature`. The `binedIVData` of the `IFHot` and `IFCold` object are used to perform the computation. The noise temperature is computed using the temperatures `tCold` and `tHot` of the cold and hot load, respectively.

## Unpumped and Pumped IV Curve Characteristics 

The goal of the computations is to recover the embedding impedance. During the process of recovering the embedding impedance, the pumping level of the SIS junction, the AC current through the SIS junction, the admittance of the SIS junction at every bias voltage, and the absolute current from the LO source.

![](Mixer_Unit_Test/2020_01_02/Unpumped_Pumped.svg)


Before computing the pumping level, the `Unpumped` data is expanded in the `set_Unpumped_Expansions` method. An expansion to larger voltages is necessary to get values at 

$$V_0 + n V_\text{Ph}$$
where $V_0$ is the bias voltage, $n$ is the Tucker summation index and $V_\text{Ph}$ is the photon voltage. The photon voltage is defined as

$$V_\text{Ph} = \frac{hf_\text{LO}}{e}$$
where $h$ is Planck's constant, $e$ is the electron charge and $f_\text{LO}$ is the frequency of the LO source. The frequency of the LO is defined in the key word arguments of the `Mixer` class as `fLO`. In turn, the  photon voltage argument `vPh` can be computed. The Tucker summation index $n$ runs in the theory from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$. This is not possible in the program and higher order of the Tucker summation index are usually leading to neglible terms. The Tucker summation index is running within the limit of the key word arguement `tuckerSummationIndex`. The `set_Unpumped_Expansions` computes an `Unpumped.binedDataExpanded` argument and an `Unpumped.iKKExpanded` argument to describe the binned IV data and its Kramers Kronig transformation over the voltage regime described above.

The pumping level $\alpha$ is computed for every bias voltage of the `Pumped.binedIVData` together with the `Unpumped.binedDataExpanded` data. The solution is found by solving the equation

$$ I(V_0,V_\text{LO}) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty J_n^2 (\alpha)\cdot I_0(V_0+n\cdot V_\text{Ph}) $$
where $\alpha = V_\text{LO}/V_\text{Ph}$, $I_0$ is the unpumped DC IV curve and $I$ is the pumped DC IV curve. $J_n$ is the $n^\text{th}$ order Bessel function of first kind.

![](Mixer_Unit_Test/2020_01_02/Pumping_Level.svg)
![](Mixer_Unit_Test/2020_01_02/Pumping_Level_masked.svg)

The AC current through the SIS junction can be computed with known pumping level `pumping_Levels` at every bias voltage.
Again the IV data of the unpumped junction `Unpumped.binedDataExpanded` is used and the corresponding Kramers Kronig transformation `Unpumped.iKKExpanded`. The real part of the SIS AC current is stored in `iACSISRe` and is calculated using the equation

$$Re\{I_\text{AC}(V_0,V_\text{LO}) \}= \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty J_n(\alpha)\cdot (J_{n-1}(\alpha)+J_{n+1}(\alpha))\cdot I_0(V_0+n\cdot V_\text{Ph}) $$

The imaginary part of the SIS AC current is stored in `iACSISIm` and is calculated using the equation

$$Im\{I_\text{AC}(V_0,V_\text{LO}) \}= \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty J_n(\alpha)\cdot (J_{n-1}(\alpha)-J_{n+1}(\alpha))\cdot I_KK(V_0+n\cdot V_\text{Ph}) $$

The real and imaginary part are combined to a complex SIS AC current quantity `iACSIS`.

![](Mixer_Unit_Test/2020_01_02/Current_through_Junction.svg)

The admittance of the SIS junction for every bias voltage can be calculated from the relationship

$$ Y_\text{SIS} = \frac{I_\text{AC}}{V_\text{LO}} $$

where the corresponding data is stored in `iACSIS` and `pumping_Levels_Volt`.
